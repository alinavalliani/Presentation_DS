## Introduction

Our data is derived from Instagram accounts and comes from the website known as Kaggle.com. The data contains usernames, followers, followers, likes, comments, and locations for different accounts. This data is interesting because it has a large sample of different accounts where we can draw conclusions about patterns in engagement scores. In the data, we used some categories, such as followers, buckets, caption lengths, and keyword buckets.
